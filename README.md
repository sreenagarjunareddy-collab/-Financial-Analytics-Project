In our project, we performed a deep dive into Amazon’s financials from 2014 to 2023, combining historical data analysis with forward-looking valuation models to assess the company’s market standing.

Here is the in-depth breakdown of our work:

1. Financial Performance & Trends (2014–2023)
We analyzed Amazon’s trajectory, identifying a massive recovery and a strong upward revenue trend (R^2 of 0.9691).
Revenue Growth: We documented net sales increasing to $574.8 billion in 2023, a 12% jump from 2022.
Net Income Turnaround: We highlighted a major shift where the company swung from a $2.7 billion loss in 2022 to a $30.4 billion profit in 2023.
Profitability Margins: We calculated that while Amazon maintains a strong Gross Profit Margin of 41.42%, its Net Profit Margin is a thin 3.70%, reflecting heavy reinvestment and high indirect costs.
2. Strategic Segment Analysis
We audited the business by segment to understand what drives its $2 trillion market cap.
AWS (Cloud): We found that Amazon Web Services generated $90.8 billion (16% of total revenue) in 2023, acting as the primary engine for operating income.
E-commerce Dominance: We confirmed Amazon holds 37.6% of the U.S. e-commerce market, far ahead of Walmart and Apple.
3. Competitive Landscape (Porter’s Five Forces)
We used this framework to evaluate the risks facing the "Amazon Empire":
Competitive Rivalry (High): We noted intense pressure from Walmart, Alibaba, and eBay in retail, and Microsoft/Google in cloud services.
Bargaining Power of Buyers (High): We identified that low switching costs for consumers force Amazon to maintain aggressive pricing and fast delivery.
Threat of New Entrants (Moderate/Low): We argued that while high capital and infrastructure requirements protect Amazon, platforms like Shopify lower the bar for smaller niche competitors.
4. Valuation & Investment Thesis
We used a "triangulation" method to estimate the stock’s fair value using multiple valuation techniques:
Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): We calculated a WACC of 11.95%, reflecting the company's risk profile and capital structure (9.26% debt).
Relative Valuation Multiples:
EBITDA Multiple: Amazon’s 26.32 significantly beats the industry average of 15.22.
Sales Multiple: Its 2.74 multiple (vs. 1.06 industry average) shows high market expectations for future growth.

The Bottom Line: Based on our analysis, we issued a "HOLD" recommendation, targeting a stock price around $185.85 as of early 2025.
